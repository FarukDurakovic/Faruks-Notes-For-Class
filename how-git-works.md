30 minutes of Git researching!

From reading the tutorial, here is what I can gather...

The primary focus of Git is a sort of version control system. An example of this is to reference the game known as Minecraft. It s a very simple game by default, but through the use of mods, it becomes much more of a fun game as it changes the default sandbox game into something more. But less about Minecraft and more about the mods themselves. I have before looked at downloading mods for this game from mod creators and when I search for the latest installments of these mods, there is usually a link to github and a list of how each change happened and details on what specifically changed and why. So when the mod author creates an update to their mod, one that adds an item to the game as an example, you can see exactly which "patch" it was implemented in, and then can shio it with their newest release. Another example is that say the author is informed that their is a bug in their mod that breaks or ruins the experience, but the author is working on different content in a 2.0 version of the mod, well they would be easily able to move to the older version and could quickly and effortlessly change the code and fix the bug. 

Git also happens to be very security heavy in the sense that it claims that all the objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. It is in place to protect the code and change history from both accidental and malicious changes!

Git is also apparently very flexible, as the tutorial says to me! It is able to support various kinds of development workflows, work with both small and large projects, and its compatible with many exisiting systems and protocols.

One more thing that I have seen in git, as well as what it mentions itself, is that it is a little bit difficult to learn. It uses some interesting terminology that I have never seen used before, with examples being Repositories, Pushing, Pulling, Origin, Master, Branches/Tags. It is also a massive pain to have to download all the new programs we need, like Docker and the Git Shell, and having to get a bash shell working... It's all very painful! 

Well regardless of how "Frustrating" it will be, I do want to learn more about Git and maybe start a career somewhere in software development!
