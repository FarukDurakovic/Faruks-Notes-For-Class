30 minutes of Git researching!

From reading the tutorial, here is what I can gather...

The primary focus of Git is a sort of version control system. An example of this is to reference the game known as Minecraft. It s a very simple game by default, but through the use of mods, it becomes much more of a fun game as it changes the default sandbox game into something more. But less about Minecraft and more about the mods themselves. I have before looked at downloading mods for this game from mod creators and when I search for the latest installments of these mods, there is usually a link to github and a list of how each change happened and details on what specifically changed and why. So when the mod author creates an update to their mod, one that adds an item to the game as an example, you can see exactly which "patch" it was implemented in, and then can shio it with their newest release.
